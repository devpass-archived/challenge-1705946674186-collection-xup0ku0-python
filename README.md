## Collection Types Challenge in Python

### Challenge Description
Implement a class `Collection` in Python that represents a collection of elements. This challenge focuses on working with various collection types in Python.

### Setup and Execution
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- Run tests using `python -m unittest test_main.py`.
- Implement your solution in `main.py`.

### Task
- Your `Collection` class should include:
  - A constructor `__init__(self)` initializing instance variables.
  - A method `add_element(self, element)` to add an element to the collection.
  - A method `remove_element(self, element)` to remove an element from the collection. If the element is not found, raise a ValueError.
  - A method `get_element_index(self, element)` to get the index of an element in the collection. If the element is not found, return -1.
  - A method `get_length(self)` to get the number of elements in the collection.
- Ensure your implementation handles edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.
